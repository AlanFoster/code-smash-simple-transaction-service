## Code Smash: Simple Transaction Service

[ShopKeep][shopkeep] engineers work with a wide range of languages and tools to deliver
great products to our customers. Our iPad register provides merchants with a
beautiful, easy to use interface that integrates with a range of cloud-based
services that provide long-term business value in terms of data management and
reporting.

As part of our Code Smash event, we'd like to give you a chance to work on an
app using one of our core tools, [Ruby on Rails][rails].

### Taking Part

If you'd like to take part in our Code Smash, please follow our short guide
on getting set up.

#### Getting Ready

We are really passionate about [Ruby][ruby] development and are always looking
for opportunities to meet developers who use or aspire to use it.

You don't need to be an expert to take part and we will have some of our
engineers standing by to help you get started, but if you want to prepare a
little beforehand, here are some things to check out:

- [Try Ruby][tryruby]: Browser-based intro to the Ruby language
- [Code Academy's Ruby Course][codeacademy]: Exercises from introductory to advanced
- [Ruby Koans][rubykoans]: Test-Driven approach to exploring Ruby, available online or for download
- [Code School's Rails for Zombies][railsforzombies]: Introduction to Ruby on Rails in a series of video tutorials and exercises

#### Sign up on GitHub

We use GitHub to manage all our projects, we think its awesome, and it makes it
very easy for you to share your solutions with us.

If you haven't already created an account, sign up for free [here][github-signup]
and read GitHub's [bootcamp][github-bootcamp] for some tips on getting started.

__Note:__ You may be eligible to apply for an academic discount. If you are
interested, please checkout out GitHub's [guide][github-academic-signup].

#### Fork the code

Hit the 'Fork' button on the top right of the GitHub project page to make your
own copy of the app that you can work on and submit at the end of the event.

If you're not familiar with command-line git, GitHub have clients for both
[Windows][github-windows] and [Mac OS][github-mac] to help you manage your
copy of the code.

#### Prepare your development environment

##### Linux

If you are comfortable working in a Linux environment, you are probably good to
go. We do strongly recommend installing [RVM][rvm] to manage Ruby versions.

##### Windows / Mac OS

If you are working on Windows or Mac OS, we've provided a template for a
virtual machine pre-installed with everything you need to get going.

You will need to install [Vagrant][vagrant] and [VirtualBox][virtualbox] for
your operating system to get going.

See the [Getting Started](doc/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide for more information.

#### Come meet us!

Finally, head over to the Ground Floor Computer Science lab at 1pm on Wednesday
the 30th of April to meet with some of our engineers and find out what you
will be building.
